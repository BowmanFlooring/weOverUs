# weOverUs README.md file

This project is currently on PAUSE.
As of today, I do NOT have a date set to resume development. In fact, development may not ever resume.

Our official GitHub page - https://github.com/BowmanFlooring - hosts many repositories like this.
I wouldn't say that any of them have been abandoned completely, because they haven't. They are great to
keep up there because we can go back and look at them as reference; what we did right, where we failed,
etc... Our GitHub is very much alive and well!

Thanks!
